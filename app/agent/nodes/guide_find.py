"""guide.find — pre-curated product lookup flow.

Single node, three phases driven by current state:

  phase 1 (no candidates yet)
    LLM extracts SearchProductsFilters from the conversation. If it has
    enough to search, we run search_products and present results +
    "are these good?" question. If not, we ask a targeted follow-up.

  phase 2 (candidates exist, user hasn't answered yet)
    The next user reply lands here; we let `guide.happy_gate` interpret
    it. This node is bypassed by the graph's conditional edge in that
    case — see graph.py.

Slot keys this node owns:
    slots.filters              dict of SearchProductsFilters
    slots.candidates           list[dict] of ProductOut
    slots.find_phase           'asking' | 'presented'

Your job is to translate the user's free-form description of what they
need into a structured SearchProductsFilters object that the search tool
can consume.

Available filters (all optional):
  family                — product family code (one of the catalog codes below)
  frame_size_mm         — number (catalog-specific; common values vary by family)
  min_nominal_torque_nm — number
  max_backlash_arcmin   — number
  variant               — family-specific variant tag (e.g. 'HP' / 'HT' on caesarplanetary)

Product family codes available in the catalog (use one of these literally
when you set `family`):
{families_block}

Set ready_to_search=true only when there's enough signal to return a
useful shortlist (1-2 filters that meaningfully narrow). If you need
more info, set ready_to_search=false and put ONE clarifying question
into follow_up_question. Never make up facts the user didn't say.
